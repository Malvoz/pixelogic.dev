# Pixelogic.Dev

## Introduction
Welcome to the Pixelogic.Dev repo! Here we keep track of the code used for our landing page listed at https://pixelogic.dev! This page is here to help show off our community and projects that we have worked on.

I want to give a huge shout out to [Cruip](https://cruip.com) for their AWESOME templates that are free to use by all! Check them out support them!

### Setting Up
(Intstructions for `Blue` template provided by Cruip.)
* First, ensure that node.js & npm are both installed. If not, choose your OS and installation method from [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and follow the instructions.
* Next, use your command line to enter your project directory.
* This template comes with a ready-to-use package file called `package-sample.json`. You just need to rename it to `package.json`, then run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies into your project.

You're ready to go! Run any task by typing `npm run task` (where "task" is the name of the task in the `"scripts"` object). The most useful task for rapid development is `watch`. It will start a new server, open up a browser and watch for any SCSS or JS changes in the `src` directory; once it compiles those changes, the browser will automatically inject the changed file(s)!

### Pull Request
Once you complete your changes, create a PR for review. Once your PR is accepted, it will be merge into `master` where it will later be added to the website.

## Conclusion
Any and all changes are highly appreciated! Be creative, have fun, and learn something new \m/
